Collate JSON
============

Utility for node.js, watches a folder for changes and outputs a JSON file with the contents of each file collected into an array.

Usage
-----

`node collateJSON.js path/to/watch/folder`

In this example, the output file would be located in ` path/to/watch/` and called `folder.json`

Optionally, after the watch folder path, you can include a list of files to exclude/ignore separated by spaces.
